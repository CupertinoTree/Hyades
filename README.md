# Hyades

### Description

Hyades is a Push-To application for iOS. It is meant to be used with an alt-az telescope, with your phone attached.
When you first launch it, you're asked to calibrate the Push-To model by pointing at two bright stars in the sky.
Then, the phone's compass and gyroscope are used to show you in real time where in the sky the telescope is pointing.

You can also search for a specific object: the app will display a real time simulation of the adjustments you have to make to find the object, as well as a view of what you should be seeing in the telescope at your chosen magnification.

### Interface

Below are a few screenshots of the UI:
